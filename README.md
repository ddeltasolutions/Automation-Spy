# Automation Spy
Automation Spy is a spy utility tool designed to inspect Microsoft UI Automation hierarchy of elements.

This tool has simple intuitive features and buttons that can be used to work with it. Can be used to navigate through MS UI Automation hierarchy of objects and inspect for properties and control patterns of each object. You can directly navigate to an element using the mouse pointer. You can also monitor UI Automation events that are raised for a specific element. Additionally, you can make actions on Automation elements using control patterns. Why Automation Spy? Because we want to make it easy to develop applications using Microsoft UI Automation technology (UIA).

It is built using the unmanaged version of UI Automation API (UIA or Windows Automation API 3.0). Located in Windows\System32\UIAutomationCore.dll, Windows Automation API 3.0 library is the latest version of UI Automation, was introduced starting with Windows 7 and was written as a Component Object Model (COM). This tool is freeware. Requirements: Windows 7 or later, .NET Framework 4.0 or later.
